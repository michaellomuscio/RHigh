\title{Performs a Chi Square Test for Independence}
\usage{
chi_sq_independence(variable1, variable2)
}
\arguments{
\item{variable1}{The first categorical variable.}

\item{variable2}{The second categorical variable.}
}
\value{
A list containing the test statistic, the degrees of freedom, the p-value, a table of observed values, and a table of expected values.
}
\description{
This function implements a Chi Square Test for Independence, a statistical hypothesis test used to
determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables in a sample.
The test compares the observed distribution of frequencies in the sample with the distribution that
would be expected if the variables were independent. The function calculates the test statistic and
the p-value. The test statistic follows a chi square distribution under the null hypothesis. The
p-value represents the probability that a chi square statistic as extreme as the observed one could
occur by chance if the null hypothesis were true.
