# RHigh
RHigh is an R package designed for high school statistics teachers. It mimics scientific calculator tools to simplify the transition to using R in class. The package makes statistical analysis engaging and accessible for students, enhancing their understanding of statistics and its practical uses.

# Why I built this tool
With the rise of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, we need to rethink how we approach high school statistics courses. Scientific calculators are expensive, cumbersome, unable to handle large datasets, and not used in academia or industry beyond high school. Researchers engage with data and utilize statistical tools using R, Python, or other powerful languages/tools. R has become easy to use and is now accessible to high school students with internet access. Giving students access to R in high school empowers them to explore real-world datasets while learning an increasingly popular tool. 

One barrier to using R in high school is the increased complexity of R compared to popular scientific calculators. This package, RHigh, aims to remove that challenge by offering statistical functions that take on the same form as those commonly found on scientific calculators. The inputs and usage are similar. This allows teachers who are familiar with the statistical functions on scientific calculators to easily transition their curriculum to utilizing R. It also means that statistics textbooks that are written with common scientific calculators in mind will still be effectively usable.

I have used this package with high school students in on-level statistics, AP Statistics, Data Science, and Introduction to Machine Learning courses. After a brief introduction to R, they were able to navigate it quite well. The simplicity of the structure of the RHigh functions helped make the transition to using R in the classroom relatively smooth.

# What functions are currently in the RHigh package?

Right now, the package contains functions that generate basic confidence intervals and perform basic hypothesis tests. I will continue to add more functions, and any suggestions or collaboration are welcome.

Below are the current functions that are available in the package.
* Confidence intervals
  * One proportion z interval
  * Two proportion z interval
  * t interval
  * Two sample t interval
* Hypothesis tests
  * One proportion z-test
  * Two proportion z-test
  * One sample t-test
  * Two sample t-test
  * Chi-square test of independence
